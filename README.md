# Campfire_Song-SBSP
I call this one, the campfire song song
Let's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our campfire song
Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song
And if you don't think that we can sing it faster then you're wrong
But it'll help if you just sing along
Bum, bum, buuum...
so gather round the fire, feel the warmth and glow 
our friends are all beside us, let the time flow 
With every strum and every laugh, our worries fade away
we will sing our hearts out, and brighten up the day 
Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song
Singing louder can you keep up? come on lets go strong 
With marshmallowes roasting and stories to share, 
We'll make memories tonight, in the cool night air
Bum, bum, buuum...
